Nevertheless, I asked XXXX to waive the late fees since it was their fault for not mailing a statement to me before but she stated that I was supposed to call them and ask about my bill and that they have no obligation to mail me anything.

04/10/2016,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Can't repay my loan,Can't decrease my monthly payments,"Back in 2003, I returned to college at XXXX years old to change careers from working XXXX and went into court reporting to get a better paying job and hopefully help secure my eventual retirement. Advancing my XXXX degree in XXXX XXXX would not offer enough pay to offset school loans and why I decided to try court reporting school at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, Oregon because they said the job started out paying {$40.00} to XXXX upwards to a XXXX figure income eventually and the course would be completed within 2-3 years. I had already attended art school for a year, but figured I still had enough financial aid to cover 2-3 more years and therefore signed up. 
In short, I and about 10-15 other students sued the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for breach of contract after finding out the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX said on average, it takes 5-7 years to complete the course and we won a judgement against the college 's insurance company. Of course, the insurance company denied culpability, our attorney dropped out not having resources to fight an insurance company, and none of us have found any attorney willing to take on the contested judgment. After 4 years of court reporting school, I ran out of financial aide and had to quit school. 
Now, although I was able to get out of my counseling job paying {$13.00} an hour after 12 years of service with that agency, now as a sales consultant I am paid {$15.00} an hour and have about {$100000.00} in student loan debt. I recently consolidated my Federal loans and waiting to hear approval for an income based repayment plan, but XXXX and Wells Fargo do not offer alternative affordable payment plans. I sent in copies of all my bills, a payment stub, a copy of the judgement and a letter explaining everything to XXXX and Wells Fargo, but say that according to their rates, I should be able to make their payments. In attempting to avoid default and have been a month behind for at least the last 4 months, I found a roommate to share expenses a month ago, but with moving expenses and new apartment deposits, I am still struggling with being able to make payments. 
Wells Fargo suggest that once my federal loans get finalized, I should apply for a forbearance to catch up with them, however at the rate of both XXXX and Wells Fargo expected payments, I will run into the same problem once that forbearance is done. And their lack of willingness to work with students shoves the interest rate accumulation to the federal loans when doing a forbearance. 
Both XXXX and Wells Fargo call me, on average, 4 days a week, XXXX times a day and while I am at work. Despite my repeated explanations to them that I can not take phone calls at work and repeated explanations are given each week, they continue the repetitious calls until I make a payment and then a week and a half later it starts all over because by then I am a month behind again. 
I am now a XXXX year old woman and under incredible stress with all of this resulting in XXXX car accidents last year sky rocketing my insurance rates and still with attempts to reduce my living expenses, I have been depleting what little retirement I had from my Mutual funds and IRA to be able to meet living expenses. At this rate, there will be nothing left way before I get to retirement age. My immediate concern is that XXXX and Wells Fargo will eventually garnish my wages despite everything I am trying to do. I have just basic living expenses and no car payment or credit card bills and still ca n't meet their school loan payments. Apparently, obtaining a legal judgement is only as good as how much money you have to fight big corporations holding vast wealth. I do not know where else to turn and desperate for help.

When they became finally convinced that I was not going to accept the loan, they sent me a letter declining my application citing insufficient income. I had originally applied for {$40000.00} and they approved me for {$32000.00}. 

The rejection lowered my FICO score and affected my ability to get better rate loans. I believe this tactic used by Best Egg is fraudulent, unethical, and vindictive and deserves to be fixed.

I purchased a laptop from an international seller, which resulted in me being charged an international fee. When balancing my checkbook, I did n't account for the international fee which resulted in me being overdrawn by {$6.00}. I was then charged a {$37.00} overdraft fee on top of it. I went into the branch and called the customer service line and they just explained that the policy is to charge anything over {$5.00}. I VERY rarely overdraw my account, and thought the bank would take care of its customers in a better manner than charging {$37.00} for an overdraft of less than {$7.00}. In addition, I made a cash deposit the very next day to cover the overdraft situation because I do n't like ever being in an overdrawn situation. This seems outrageous, and I believe the Truth in Savings regulation should be updated to no longer allow any overdraft fee greater than the amount actually overdrawn.

However this can not be true. Per XXXX XXXX 's own website : "" Consumers are sometimes mistakenly advised that because their government-insured or government-guaranteed loans XXXX serve as collateral for XXXX-guaranteed securities, XXXX XXXX determines servicing decisions regarding their loans. 

However, XXXX XXXX does not set standards for mortgages that are to be federally insured or guaranteed.

Dovenmuehle 's business is mortgage servicing and therefore they should be able to provide more accurate information regarding mortgage servicing to consumers.

It is disingenuous and irresponsible for Dovenmuehle to pass off the responsibility of their own policies on another entity. It is also concerning that phone representatives and supervisors in a company dedicated to mortgage servicing are so mistaken about their own business, industry, and regulatory environment.

02/06/2016,Credit reporting,,Incorrect information on credit report,Account status,"I have a collection record on my credit report with Experian. This collection is regarding a medical bill. The reason that this bill is not paid on time is that I was never informed that I have this unpaid bill by either the hospital or collection company. 

First, I have never been contacted by hospital for this bill, and I thought it is paid by my insurance company. Second, after the bill was transferred to the collection company, XXXX XXXX, this collection company never contacted me regarding this bill as well. In fact, I never know this unpaid bill was existing until the landlord told me I had a collection in credit report when I applied the apartment in 2014. 

It is the hospital and collection company 's fault for not contacting me, while not my fault to refuse to pay it. My insurance company can cover the bill directly, so that I do not have motivation to default on it. Both XXXX and Experian have removed this wrong information after I dispute with them.

He said he represented Eastpoint Group and was in XXXX, NY. He was very polite, as was I, and I explained that my loan agreement gave me 5 years to pay off the debt and if I did not within XXXX, would begin to accrue interest. He told me a lot of people make those mistakes and I was supposed to make payments during the 5 years anyway. I began allowing him to take {$100.00} from my account every payday ( and they collected {$500.00} ). I asked XXXX XXXX to send me some forms in the mail so I coulod verify the account and show the total debt and the payoff. I did not receive any paperwork, and due to a medical injury, lost my secondary employment. I called XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) and explained my situation and again asked him to mail paperwork to me. My intention was to pay off the debt as soon asd i received my IRS refund, and he was agreeable to that. Then another person from Eastpoint began calling my mother 's house downstate ( I never gave her number and she is almost XXXX years old ). That person said his name was XXXX XXXX with Eastpoint Group ( XXXX ) ; he has called and left messages several times stating that he would have to take more serious action if he could not get in touch with me ( which scared my mother ). She does n't answer and lets home phone calls go to voicemail. Last evening, my husband got a call on his cellphone from XXXX and a female asked him for me. I answered on his cell phone and the female immediately began harassing me about a debt. When I found out she was with Eastpoint, I told her I was already working with Attorney XXXX XXXX with her company and he was aware of my situation and I was waiting on my IRS return to pay in full. I then told her I was still waiting on paperwork and had received nothing by USPS yet. I told her I would not speak with anyone else until I received something verifying who they were and what I owed, who was the original debtor and what was left to pay off. She refused to agree to sending me any validation paperwork and became extremely rude and actually screamed at me in a shrill voice, "" I do n't think you are going to pay this off! '' At that point I just hung up. I then called XXXX XXXX and asked him to return my call today due to another person calling with harassing and disturbing behavior. He has not called back. 

I did online research and have read about fraudulent collectors, and also found out that XXXX XXXX is not an attorney as he told me he was. This evening, I called back the number the woman called from last night and it went to voicemail where the message identified the woman as XXXX XXXX or XXXX - I could not clearly hear the last name. 

I am very concerned that this company already has {$500.00} from me, they have never sent a validation notice or any actual paperwork at all, and I see numerous complaints about the company. I want to pay off my debt but do n't know whether this is a true collection or fraud, due to the lies told and the tactics used by several of their employees.

According to HUD documentation ( XXXX ), "" The law provides XXXX situations in which borrower paid PMI may be cancel - it can be automatic or by request. Lender-paid PMI is excluded from these mandates, but requires an up front disclosure to the borrower about lender-paid PMI. 
The XXXX cancellation situations are : Automatic. In general, when the homeowner 's equity position reaches 22 percent of the original value of the property, the mortgage servicer must automatically cancel the PMI. The borrower must be current in making payments for automatic cancellation to apply. "" According to CFPB documentation ( XXXX ) "" Automatic PMI termination Even if you do n't ask your lender to cancel PMI, your lender still must terminate PMI on the date when your principal balance is scheduled to reach 78 percent of the original value of your home. You also need to be current on your payments on the anticipated cancellation date. Otherwise, PMI will not be terminated until shortly after your payments are brought up to date. 

It 's worth noting a termination request is different than a cancellation request. Your lender must terminate PMI even if the principal balance of your loan has not actually reached 78 percent of the original value of your home - for example, because the value of your home declined. '' I have never been late on a payment, and have always paid extra principle. My loan is over 5 years old. 
The lender is basing their denial on the "" scheduled '' date when I reach 78 %, which would not have been until XX/XX/2017, but since I always pay extra principle, that date has arrived sooner.

Upon applying for college student financial aid, the federal government would not cover the full cost for me to attend my first or second year of college so I was then forced to seek financial assistance elsewhere. At the time, there were only XXXX private sources to obtain student financial aid, Wells Fargo being XXXX. After my first two years of college I was able to move out of the dorms and into a much cheaper house where I was also able to afford tuition by just federal financial aid, without having to apply for private student loans such as through Wells Fargo. I graduated XX/XX/XXXX with my XXXX and then made the move XXXX to begin my career XXXX at the age of XXXX. As a XXXX who just moved to a new area, it is hard to make a good career immediately after graduating, it takes time to build up a steady career, as anyone who is in the XXXX industry knows. That XXXX day where I have to start making student loan payments is about to knock on the door, so I knew I had to start making student loan payments from Wells Fargo six months after graduating, but what I did not know were the decapitating hardships and tears brought out of a grown XXXX man from the stresses of dealing with repaying my student loans to Wells Fargo month after month as well as my federal student loans. It is this way because Wells Fargo insists it be this way and i say that because of their uncaring and unhumane attitude towards helping an individual such as myself through a situation that many more will fall into. That dreadful day comes when i receive my first student loan bill from wells fargo, {$310.00} per month is steep no matter how one analyzes it so i call Wells Fargo to figure out a way to reduce that payment and the best option for me was to apply for an income based repayment plan, which i immediately applied for, the next day a man named XXXX from wells fargo, was speaking with my father ( cosigner ) about three things : one, how much money do you make each month ; two, how much is your rent ; and three, if he was currently paying any child support etc. XXXX got the rest of the information he needed over a credit report and based off of those parameters alone, i myself was denied a payment reduction plan. after receiving this agonizing news i called XXXX back to ask him why i had been denied. to which he replies "" Well based off of your fathers current income status he can "" easily '' afford to make those payments for you. '' i said "" Sir, with all do respect, i graduated college with the midset that i do n't need my parents to support me financially and that it can not possibly be fair of me to expect them to make MY student loan payments for me. '' to which he replies "" i am a father so i can respect that but we can not reduce your payment based off the fact that your father is "" well-off '' enough to make the payments for you, so you need to tell your father to step up and make the payments for you. '' Internally, i was immediately enraged, how dare you tell me how to talk to my father, disrespectfully. i was not brought up that way and that comment was utterly rude and unhumane. i can not believe my efforts to reduce my monthy payment was denied based off of very minuscule premises and XXXX very disrespectful man. i feel they do not care about anything more than getting their money back. Not the quality of the repayers ' life, not bankruptcy, not the person, nothing.

02/09/2016,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"OCWEN is the servicing bank : has held homeowner in extending processing, and not evaluating documents properly. Homeowner has submitted the RMA requesting modification. Homeowner has been in default since XXXX/XXXX/2015 and is 991 days passed due. Homeowner is formally appealing the denial based on errors in home value, income, DTI and LTV Loan to Values used by the services in the denial of the RMA application. 
The service'r has commenced double tracking while homeowner was acting in good faith under the DOJ/XXXX States Attorney Generals Agreement : the National Mortgage Settlement Agreement. 

The servicer ' is discriminating against homeowner claims, in a form of reverse discrimination ; holding the mortgage in extended processing, denying a loan modification while homeowner is qualified, lost documents when homeowner has already provided. 

This homeowner, feels that their case has been unfairly treated for the following reasons : 1. No active single point of contact, constantly changing, when calls made to the single point of contact, routine routed to the collection department, never the same contact person. 
2. A Single point of contact was assigned ; calls were made to the point of contact : the calls were never returned by the contact. Calls returned were from the collection department and never the same so called : "" relationship manager ''. 
3. The service'r has held the homeowner in extended process in bad faith, during which the value of property has increased and fallen for 991 days from XXXX/XXXX/2015 to XXXX/XXXX/2015. 
4. On the last RMA application : all requested documents were provided as requested. Homeowner has confirmation via fax that documents were received by the service, bank claims that documents lost. 
5. Homeowner has made numerous calls ( 20 ) inquiring on status of application, as a foreclosure date has been set and reset ; calls were routed to next available collection department agent, comments were : A ) wrongfully advised that documents were not submitted, or B ) documents were submitted, or C ) resubmit documents because documents lost, or D ) the foreclosure date is set and homeowner is responsible for not providing the requested documents : these XXXX points are causing a state of confusion and terror to the homeowner. 
6. Servicer started a double tracking procedure upon the notice of default. The foreclosure agent was aware of the loan modification in process, and moved forward with the double tracking anyway. 
This is a clear violation under the National Mortgage Settlement Agreement ; specifically double tracking while homeowner provided all documents under good faith. 
7. Homeowner has contacted the foreclosure agent before the foreclosure sale : that the sale was extended to another 30 days. Service'r never advised homeowner of the extended sale date. 
9. As of the above CFPB complaint date above, service'r has not advised or confirmation that the foreclosure date of sale is on hold. 
10. Homeowner is in a state of fear created by the collection tactics by Service'r and or the foreclosure agent. 
11. Homeowner was not advised of their HAMP/Department of Justice modification guidelines or options. 
12. Homeowner was not provided the name of the investor as requested. 
13. Homeowner was not provided a NPV Net Present Value Report to approve or deny the RMA application. 

The Banks ' failure to discharge their required loan modification obligations, during homeowner 's honest attempt to save their home from foreclosure. 
Homeowner is claiming mortgage processing discrimination in delaying processing : by overloading servicer 's processing agents with a case work load of XXXX+ cases as per agents statement : ( disclosed by relationship manager via recorded conversation, for training and quality assurance ). 

We formally appeal the loan modification denial. We request that a SPOC Special Point of Contact be assigned homeowner.

02/01/2016,Debt collection,"Other (i.e. phone, health club, etc.)",Taking/threatening an illegal action,Threatened to sue on too old debt,"I am writing to report Portfolio Associates for harassment and making threatening statements. 

On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I received a call on my home phone but did not recognize the number. I called back and found it was Portfolio Associates calling about a debt which is more than 12 years old. The debt was disputed but never resolved and since has been expunged from my credit history. I explained to the representative ( I believe her name was XXXX ) I was not going to pay the debt and instructed her to place a "" do not call '' on my account. XXXX stated she would do that. Since that time, I have continued to receive several calls a week. Many of them placed twice on the same day. I have a record in my caller ID log. 

On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I sent a registered letter to XXXX XXXX, Human Resources Director. I told XXXX XXXX I did not want any further communication from Portfolio Associates ( mail or telephone ). The letter was delivered on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I have delivery verification. 

After the letter was received, several more calls have been placed to me. What they are doing is phoning under an ID which does not specify Portfolio Recovery. I do not answer the phone then call them back and it is Recovery Portfolio. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, at XXXX XXXX the ID listed XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX. I spoke to a representative. I told her I was not to receive any more calls and she tried to argue with me but I hung up. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX at XXXX XXXX the ID listed the caller as XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX. I called back and could not understand the representative 's name. I told her I have written a letter stating I am not to be contacted in any way, shape or form. The representative looked up my account and stated there were not any notes on it saying to not call me. I explained I do not owe the debt and the representative asked if I had paid the debt with XXXX XXXX to which I replied it was irrelevant. I told the representative I filed a complaint with the FCC and what they are doing is considered harassment. She stated she would send a notice to the dispute department. 

On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I received a call from XXXX, XXXX at XXXX XXXX : XXXX XXXX XXXX. The representative identified himself as being from Portfolio Recovery. He stated he is trying to collect an old debt and read a disclaimer stating I can be sued in court. I told him this is the 4th time I have stated I do not want any calls. Further I explained I sent a registered letter which was received. The representative stated it is not in the system. This is precisely what the representative on XXXX XXXX stated. The letter was written on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and received on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. 

I wish to file a formal complaint against Portfolio Recovery for harassment and threatening to sue me for a disputed debt more than 12 years old which I do not owe. I am unfamiliar with this process and would appreciate notice of how I am to proceed. 

Thank you for your time with this.

After I discovered I could not access my account, I called the customer service number and was informed that my account had been closed on XXXX. Nobody could tell me why, but they explained that a check was "" in the mail '' for my account balance, and I would be receiving correspondence that would provide some level of clarity to the situation. 

GE Capital provided me with a tracking number for the supposed package being mailed from them. After submitting a tracking inquiry via XXXX, I learned that my check was actually being mailed to GE Capital 's headquarters. According to XXXX, that check arrived at their headquarters on Wed, XXXX/XXXX/2016 at XXXX. 

I called GE Capital back to hopefully gain some clarity on the matter without satisfaction. Was not provided a reason for closing of the account or an estimated time frame or a reasonable expectation for when I might receive my check. I attempted to escalate the issue to a "" Floor Manager '' and unfortunately obtained no new information regarding what had happened or what will happen. 

The following day I receive a call from GE Capital from a representative "" dedicated '' to these types of problems. I was informed that the check was in fact not coming to me. I was informed that the check was, in fact, being sent to their headquarters for a "" review ''. And that after the review was complete, my check would be processed and sent to me. I was also told that I would be contacted and provided with a tracking number for the check once their "" review '' was complete. Was told that I should hear from them by XX/XX/2016. 

It 's now Friday XX/XX/2016, and I 've heard from nobody at GE Capital. My account was a savings account only in which I make monthly deposits ranging from {$200.00} - {$2000.00}. 

So, without any further information, I contacted my attorney and a close friend of mine who is a XXXX. My friend has informed me that the only possible reason this could be happening is if GE Capital 's internal systems have generated a "" Suspicious Activity Report '' on my account. 

Now I would like to file a "" Suspicious Activity Report '' on GE Capital. Oops. Forgot ... .I do n't have the right to do something like that. I 'm only a U.S. citizen. Not an XXXX banking institution.

04/09/2016,Bank account or service,Checking account,Problems caused by my funds being low,,"when I was employed by XXXX XXXX Services I was getting a pay check every week. The company was struggling financially, but they kept paying me on time with no problems. I was faithful to this company for 7 years. We where a small company of less than XXXX employees. We had a shop of XXXX guys and sometimes they would get a check sometimes they would n't. but he kept my paychecks on time. What happened next really surprised me. I was going out of town and return on wednesday. Friday before the weekend he handed me a company check, never does he do that it has always been a direct deposit, so after work around XXXX I deposited the check through ATM. I had US bank as my only bank at the time. Saturday morning i went to the bank and i withdrew {$400.00} dollars and i know it was that amount, because banks wont allow you to withdrawl more for safety reasons. I had {$200.00} in my checking when i made the withdrawl, but because i deposited a night before i was able to take an additional {$200.00}. I did n't want to take more because i had rent to pay that week, so i only wanted to spend what i had in hand. When i get back from my vacation i went to put gas at a gas station and my card was declined, i have no idea why it was declined. I had money in my checking. I tried using it again at the market and again it was declined. so the next day i call my bank and they said my account is closed! they said i commited fraud i did n't understand what i did. They said i should go inside my branch to discuss with the manager so i went in and they told me that the check i deposited bounced and that i withdrew money more then what i had. i explained to them that was a company check and i withdrew because their atm allowed me to take {$200.00} above what i had in my account. So they said they closed all my savings and checking. They put a hold on any money i had in there until they can resolve the issue. The following day i went to the owners bank. XXXX XXXX and explained to manager what happened he said he could n't do much. The owner found out i went to his bank and he really got upset because he said i could of ruined his credit and chances of getting loans. I told him he put me on a black list and it was his fault for bouncing the check he said he was sorry and that he can issue another. That was to late because US bank did n't want to work with me or help me they just shut me down with no phone call or allow me to resolve the issue they just closed all accounts and didnt warn me. I felt betrayed by all parties my employer and my bank. I told US bank that there will be a direct deposit going in that Friday if they can please just take me off the list, they said it was to late they already put it and they could n't do much. I felt that was wrong because not once did they call me to resolve this or give me the chance to fix it. I only found out when i tried to put gas. This has been now years of stress that i can not open any checking account. I have XXXX account and only because my father opened it for me. Its very difficult with only having XXXX bank when they are closed weekends and they are XXXX from me if i ever want to walk inside the branch. I would like US Bank to please take me off this list as it was inaccurate and not fraud.

I called and disputed charges in the mean time as fraud since it is more difficult to have this credit card removed from my name. While I am waiting, there is still more and more charges occuring. Luckily, the bank has shut down the card about 10 months ago. Although somehow there are a couple of merchants still being able to charge my card. I have called a few months ago and advised them that I recently noticed an unauthorized large payment ( approx. {$9700.00} ) come out XXXX of my bank accounts. They still have not returned this money to me! How can a payment be taken out of my bank account when it is closed and the card was opened it without my permission? Furthermore, there was checking accounts that was opened with this bank in my name also without my permission and they 're now overdrawn. I reported that to them and they denied it. I am getting very upset because this is not my account and money was taken out of my checking account. The bank also contacted me asking me if I was trying to access my account at a time that I was n't, hence how I know someone is stealing my identity. I can not even access my account online to see anything. PLEASE RESOLVE THIS! Sadly, I can only trust my government more than my bank. This is not 0 % fraud liability as they always say!!!

Each time I attempt to begin an online dispute, upload supporting documents, or gain access through a third party credit monitoring subscription program, Experian redirects me to a message stating "" for security purposes we ask that you mail us your documents along with a government issued ID, etc. "". 

That message is getting extremely intolerable for me and I have my personal contact information to update, accounts to claim full responsibility on, account information to correct, and supporting documentation to provide along with it. 

Experian has by far the worst online dispute feature out of all three major credit reporting agencies. 

This must be changed. Surely I am not the only one experiencing this inconvenience. 

Experian expects an individual without a source of income, or available funds to go out to a store and purchase mailing envelopes and mailing stamps. 

I am unable to send Experian my information by mail because I do not have the money to purchase the items necessary to proceed with my dispute they 'd like to have mailed rather than submitted online.

This error had already been corrected so I stopped in to the XXXX NY HSBC branch. A representative by the name of XXXX pulled up my account and said she did not see the error. She explained I must have shaken the phone to have made the duplicate deposit. I tried to explain the backstory, she did not listen and tried to say it was a User error. I tried to show her the transaction on my phone and point out the discrepancy but she simply said her computer did not reflect any errors. She said when she went to her "" home '' branch on Monday she would look into further. XXXX/XXXX/XXXX Monday I received a call from XXXX saying she saw no discrepancies on her end. I asked to speak to her supervisor and she said she was the supervisor. I told her this is unacceptable becaus it clearly shows XXXX debits from my account. I went on to try and explain that only XXXX debit was needed to fix the error. We went back and fourth and finally I told her I would escalate this through corporate. I was not getting any assistance from her. I called HSBC XXXX and was told by the represenative on the phone she could see the error and she would process the request to have it resolved. However, based on the correspondence with "" XXXX '' the XXXX NY branch service manager I would like to have this escalated to ensure it is properly corrected in a timely time frame.

XXXX/XXXX/2016 To whom it may concern : Please note that that this is not a refusal to pay off the account, but a notice sent as per the Fair Debt Collection practices Act, 15 USC 1692g Sec. 809 ( b ). The notice states that your claim is disputed and validation of the account is required. 

This notice is not a request for verification of the account or proof of my mailing address, but a request for validation made pursuant to the FDCPA laws. I humbly request that your agency/office sends me valid proof that I am legally obligated to pay you. 

Please provide me with the below mentioned things : * The amount you claim I owe you * Explain and show me how you have computed the amount * Send me the copies of any documents that prove I agreed to pay the alleged amount * Identify the original creditor * Confirm that the account has not crossed the SOL period * Prove that you 're a licensed debt collector XXXX Show me your license numbers and registered agent. 

I would like to inform you that in case your agency has reported invalidated account information to any of the XXXX main Credit Bureau 's such as XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, then it will be regarded as a fraudulent action under both the federal and state laws. Due to this reason, if any, negative item is reported to any of my credit reports by your agency or the agency that you represent, then I will be compelled to take legal steps against you for the below mentioned reasons : * Violation of the FCRA * Violation of the FDCPA * Defamation of character If your agency can provide me with the requested documents, I will need minimum 30 days to investigate this information, and during this period of time, all collection activities must be stopped. 

I would like to further inform you that if any action is taken ( during the validation period ) which could be regarded as detrimental to any of my credit reports, then I will seek advice from my attorney for lawsuit. This includes listing any information on a credit report that could be incorrect or invalidated, or confirming an account as correct when in fact there is no provided proof that it is. 

If your agency/company fails to respond to this debt validation request within a period of 30 days from the date of your receipt, then the account information must be completely deleted from my credit report, and a copy of such deletion request should be sent to me at once. 

I would also like to request, in writing, that no calls should be made by your agency or company at my residence or workplace. If your agency attempts to make unlimited or computer generated calls to me or any third parties, then it will be considered harassment, and I will have no option but to file lawsuit. All future communications with me should be done in writing and sent to the address mentioned in this letter. ""

Doing well the first few years, I struggled in XX/XX/XXXX and then again in XX/XX/XXXX, due to losing my job and health issues. I thought CitiMortgage Loss Mitigation department was helping me, unfortunately the "" re finance '' was more than what I owed on my home, more than what it was worth, and higher monthly payments. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, I had XXXX and was out of work for a while plus IRS placed a tax levy on my payroll. I was having a hard time again with my mortgage payments. I decided to do a short sale, so I would not have a foreclosure. I spoke with a man by the name of XXXX XXXX with CitiMortgage and he told me "" once I had a buyer that CitiMortgage would then work with my realtor ''. 

I then had XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX / short sale specialist ) out to my home and listed my house a short sale. After several offers we had one in XXXX XXXX that was reasonable of XXXX, with earnest money of XXXX down. XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, had the contract with all information needed sent to CitiMortgage. 
It has been a nightmare. After eight months of sending CitiMortgage ( through XXXX XXXX ) all of our bank statements, payroll stubs, hardship letters, my mother 's retirement statements, her bank statements, our XXXX 's and tax records for the last several years. They continue to keep us hanging and waiting for the next step. Every time CitiMortgage wanted more information we would send it. 
Now, CitiMortgage sends us a memo : Good Afternoon XXXX, I trust both you and XXXX are well. This is your regular weekly status update email, in which I regret to report we have crossed the hard stop deadline on liquidation assistance prior to foreclosure ( thanks to the sale date that appeared since your last update, placing the deadline back on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ). The only options at this stage are to reinstate or payoff the loan ( including legal costs/fees, quotes for which may be obtained directly from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX ), or declare other legal debt protection measures. Should I see anything of note this coming week I will contact you as soon as feasibly possible, otherwise you may look forward to your weekly status updates up until XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Please do not hesitate to jot yourself a note for our regular weekly contact or reply to this email if you have any questions in the interim, and since it 's a new month I would appreciate a quick "" thank you '' to acknowledge receipt of this message. 
Remember, during any point of your treatment review you can reach me at ( XXXX ) XXXX, Ext. XXXX, Monday - Friday XXXX XXXX. - XXXX XXXX. ( CT ), or email me XXXXXXXXXXXX. I look forward to working with you.

They continued to automatically charge my credit card on file for an additional months bill in XXXX. I called/online chat with them numerous times and was told the money would be credited back when a final bill was issued. I have yet to receive this final bill. I filed a dispute with my CC to protect myself. XXXX tried to claim I owe them this money, after their agents have told me thru repeated conversations ( see attached ) that they would clear up issue and that I did not in fact owe any money ( since it was monies they had over charged me ). Despite continued correspondence with XXXX several times a month since last XXXX, they continued to refer me to their 3rd party collection company. I talked with Sunrise several time to clear up the matter. I forwarded all the XXXX chats to the collection company ( Sunrise Credit Services Inc ). I just received a new collection bill from XXXX XXXX for the same issue. I called Sunrise and they only told me that the account had been removed from their system. I have not been negligent, I have contacted XXXX and Sunrise at every step of the way and continue to be told that the issue has been resolved and no debt is due by XXXX and continue to be lead on a goose chase by Sunrise, only to find out later by written mail that the have escalated the claim. At this point I feel XXXX is harassing me and has costed me hours of my time and much distress in trying to clear up the issue. I do n't know what to do to get them to keep their promises and clear up the Account. I can not continue to waste time corresponding with them, when they tell me one thing and do the opposite. Can you help me to get XXXX to keep their word and stop harassing me for debt ( {$120.00} at this point ) that they already promised me was resolved? Thank you

Then records indicate that we refinanced our home on XXXX XXXX XXXX for {$460000.00} with XXXX. Records indicate that in XXXX, XXXX went chapter XXXX bankruptcy in XXXX Delaware. The trustee for XXXX sent us an email stating that they sold our note and Deed of Trust to XXXX XXXX in XXXX. Documentation reflects that we contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX multiple times which was at that time a servicing company that was owned by Goldman Sachs. We requested in writing ( certified mail ) from XXXX XXXX XXXX, to provide us assignments of all the investors that owned our note and Deed of Trust since XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX failed to provide the documentation that we requested. Then we contacted XXXX, our trustee by email. We requested to know who was the current investor of our note since the trustee collects the payments from the servicer and maintains investors/security holder records. XXXX stated in the email that the investor was XXXX funding. I found out that XXXX funding and it 's affiliates also went chapter XXXX in XXXX Delaware in XXXX. Goldman Sachs then sold XXXX XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX. We requested in writing ( certified mail ) assignments of all investors since XXXX. XXXX stated that XXXX loan trust XXXX owns our note and deed of trust. This is incorrect because this note and deed of trust is ONLY placed within this trust and are NOT the investors. This reflects on the original note and deed of trust that the servicer must go by! NOW ; even though we had a modification, the modification does NOT in anyway reflect who the current investor is and if the investor obtained this note legally! The current investor must prove legal ownership of this note and deed of trust by providing a copy of all assignments going all the way back to XXXX! Then we sent Goldman Sachs a letter by certified mail requesting to know who is our investor and provide assignments going all the way back to XXXX. As of today, we have not received the assignments ( proof of ownership ) that we requested from Goldman Sachs. The assignments that we are requesting would reflect who our current investor is, who owned this note prior, dates when purchase, dates when sold, going all the way back to XXXX. I believe that XXXX, Goldman Sachs, XXXX XXXX servicing and XXXX XXXX XXXX do not have these assignment records of who owns or owned this note! We believe fraud has occurred! We are still requesting all assignments going all the way back to XXXX. Now ; as I stated before, the trustee for XXXX sold this note and deed of trust to Goldman Sachs in XXXX. If Goldman Sachs did sell this note during the financial crises, then Goldman Sachs may have misled the new mortgage bond investor during the financial crises. Goldman Sachs must be required to provide the documentation ( assignments ) that we are seeking going all the way back to XXXX.

Now ; documentation shows that XXXX XXXX mortgage does not own this note or deed of trust. XXXX XXXX mortgage went chapter XXXX in XXXX Delaware in XXXX. Then, documentation shows that Goldman Sachs purchased this Note/Deed of trust in XXXX from the XXXX XXXX mortgage trustee. In XXXX, XXXX Bank which is the trustee for this note and trust ( XXXX loan trust XXXX ) stated in an email that XXXX funding is the issuer of the asset backed security. This company is technically the owners of this note as of XXXX, per XXXX Bank the trustee! Now, XXXX funding and all of it 's affiliates went chapter XXXX in XXXX Delaware in XXXX and was ordered to sell all their assets. On multiple occasions, I had sent certified letters to our servicers, XXXX Bank, Goldman Sachs and requested to know who owns or who is the investor of our note, I also requested assignments going all the way back to New XXXX Mortgage so I can know who were the previous investors and who the current investor of our note is. As of today, no one has provided the information that I had requested. Now ; everyone has been talking about the XXXX movie. This movie was based on actual events, regarding the build up of the housing and credit bubble during the XXXX. In XXXX, eccentric hedge fund manager XXXX XXXX discovered that the XXXX housing market is extremely unstable, being based on subprime loans that are high risk and providing fewer and fewer returns. Predicting that the market will collapse sometime in the second quarter of XXXX, he realizes that he can profit from this situation by creating a credit default swap market, allowing him to bet against the housing market. Later, trader XXXX XXXX hears of XXXX actions and soon realizes that XXXX predictions are likely true. He decides to put is own stake in the credit default swap market. Then a phone call was placed to hedge fund manager XXXX XXXX to alert him. The XXXX discovered that the impending market collapse is being further perpetuated by the sale of collateralized debit obligations ( CDOs ), groups poor loans that are packaged together and given fraudulent XXXX ratings due to the conflict of interest and dishonesty of the rating agencies. The market as you well know collapsed just as XXXX XXXX predicted and he produced 489 % profits from the plan! Now ; I believe that these large companies, Banks or investors failed to keep track of there mortgage assignments which are required to prove ownership of the asset backed security like our note/deed of trust! Our note/deed of trust was placed into XXXX loan trust XXXX. XXXX are the letters for Goldman Sachs reality which is a company that is owned by Goldman Sachs. I also believe that Goldman Sachs like other Banks and investors took part of these fraudulent activities. XXXX loan trust does NOT own our note/deed of trust. I believe that Goldman Sachs and XXXX Bank is not providing who the current investor is, possibly due to fraud and no assignments are available which would prove ownership of our Note/Deed of Trust!

When we asked them to "" re-open '' the account they indicated that they could n't and we 'd need to reapply. 
My complaint is, an e-mail is not a notification when it comes to something financial. Especially since we had just received new chip enabled cards the in previous couple months with an expiration date of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. In this case CITI bank left us in an extremely bad situation, as this was the credit card we had planned on using while we were traveling. Now I am hoping that this has n't messed with our credit.

The offers demonstrate preapproved deals and some even come with a card and check. I call them and I ask them specific question to avoid any middle broker taking my critical financial information to multiple other companies that may or may not be direct lenders "" ARE YOU A DIRECT LENDER AND IS THIS YOUR OWN FUND? ''. I specifically asked them to confirm that they are a direct lender. I will not seek credit from a broker as we have been burnt in the past by fraud. Also, these brokers share my application. I found out that there is a website called XXXX leads and the brokers have found out about my application and shared it among others. There were XXXX inquiries submitted against my Experian credit file by several banks repeatedly in a few days that I have not applied for credit with them and I am not even familiar with them. These brokers lied that they are direct lender and never obtained my approval to run my personal credit. My credit file is now abused by XXXX hard inquiries that I do not even know who initiated them. I want these fraudulent inquiries removed from my personal Credit file urgently as it is impacting my clean and strong credit history. 

Unfortunately it seems that they easily lied and produced my financial information to multiple other companies accessing my personal credit report with a Hard Inquiry. I was scammed with almost XXXX hard pulls almost destroying my credit file. 

I have also more specifically asked them prior to running my credit I must see their type of offer to make sure the type of the loan product is acceptable to our company. 

I have frozen my credit file as I can not tolerate these liar brokers that are all over the country introducing themselves as direct lender or having exclusive relationship. 

I am seeking your help to remove the disputed fraudulent inquiries below.

I fell behind on my mortgage and was unable to catch it up. Luckily i learned of a program in my state called the hardest hit fund. They paid my mortgage up through XXXX/XXXX/XXXX at this point i would start making my regular payments. so on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX i called to make my payment and The Gentleman that was the representative for DITECH Servicing told me there were still {$1700.00} just sitting and waiting to be applied to my payments he said once this happened i would need to make a payment of {$74.00}. once this was done this would pay me current until XXXX XXXX XXXX. I said are you sure because i thought the hardest hit fund was only going to pay me up until XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. He said yes Sir I am completely positive im sitting right here looking at it. I said well ok so he ran my card for {$74.00}. I got home told my wife what had happened she then called them and spoke to a lady representative and asked how much we owed for this month, the representitive said Mamm you are paid up until XXXX XXXX XXXX she ok are you sure we do not owe any thing she said i am 100 % certain. So my wife hung up. We assumed the system had messed up when they were applying the funds from the hardest hit fund. We recieved our statement in the mail it said paid up until XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. So we thought everything is ok. Well on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX i received a call from the representitive with DITECH Servicing and she told me that i needed to pay my account and that it was almost 60 days behind. I said how is this possible they said the only payment they had received was a payment of {$74.00} i still owed {$1700.00}. They then told me that the {$1700.00} in funds was in a check that a gentleman from California wrote and just so happened to be for the amount of what my house payment was for and he had written my account number on the check. They realized it was a mistake and so they reversed that payment leaving me now owing the {$1700.00} and they want it paid immediately. So i asked for my Designated account rep to give me a call so i could speak to one person about all of this. She did so on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX she said it was very confusing and would need to do some research on it. so she called me back XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and tells me there is nothing they can do for me that i must pay these funds i said there is no way i can t=do this i do not have the money. i said shouldnt be responsible for a mistake on your companies side. So she transfers me to her supervisor the supervisor was so rude it wasnt funny she said Sir what would you like to happen out of this? Just make this amount disappear make it vanish? I said well yes i think you guys should eat it this is not my fault and you have said that but now im left oweing for 2 months worth of payments. and you guys do not care. She said the best we could do is split these payments up into 4 months and you will {$430.00} on top of your current payment each month. I said how in the world am i supposed to afford the extra {$430.00} a month? Then she said if you do not except foreclosure proceedings will continue and will stand have a nice day sir goodbye. Now i do not know what to do or how i will afford it?? Please help!! After all of this i have started looking online and Ditech Used to be called Greentree Servicing and now their are law suits against both companies right now pending and tons of complaints for the same problems i am going through right now.

03/30/2016,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Application, originator, mortgage broker",,"I recently became aware that Amerisave Mortgage Corporation participated in some illegal practices that harm customers. I did not know at the time ( until recently ) that I had any legal recourse for an issue I had, and I would like to seek restitution at this time. I applied for a 30 year fixed rate mortgage loan with Amerisave on XXXX/XXXX/06 ( loan application # XXXX ). As part of the process I paid for an appraisal. I also paid for "" discount points '' to lower the interest rate on the mortgage. These payments were made through my credit card on XXXX/XXXX/06, and I have those records. Shortly after I cancelled the loan, as the terms had not been satisfactory. It was my understanding that the {$390.00} appraisal fee was non-refundable, but the {$3000.00} that was paid in discount points should have been reimbursed. I inquired many times to Amerisave to get this {$3000.00} reimbursement and they said they could not refund the money. Not only was this bad customer service, but caused customer harm to me in a deceptive and possibly illegal action of not returning the {$3000.00} in funds. Although it has been nearly 10 years, I would like to have this money refunded to me. I did not know at the time that I had any rights to get this money back, and was told to the contrary. Please advise. Thank you.

02/12/2016,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Application, originator, mortgage broker",,"Bank of America has demonstrated an on-going level of incompetence, callous disregard for the wellbeing of its customer and negligence in their responsibility to adequately guide a client through a loan process. Because of their unprofessional behavior we have suffered extraordinary emotional hardship and they have inflicted a financial burden on us not initially intended when we applied for the loan. 

One of many issues is as follows. After going through an extraordinarily difficult mortgage finalization process I wrote to the president of Bank of America. Within a very short time I received calls from a corporate representative in XXXX, another representative in XXXX and a regional District Sales Manager. 

My issue, at this point, is the way they have opted to getting around paying what they said they would pay me. In response to my complaint they agreed to cover the cost of the house appraisal and to honor their "" guaranteed close '' agreement. In a discussion with the District Sales Manager he stated that a reimbursement of travel costs due to their inadequate notification that our initial close date could not be met. We discussed the rates to be utilized to arrive at a figure and he said that actual receipts would not be needed. He asked if this approach would be acceptable. I told him to email all that we have talked about and I will review it with my wife. Here is what the representative from the corporate office wrote me soon after : "" XXXX XXXX, I spoke with XXXX and he asked me to pass along this information to you regarding your request for reimbursement. If you have any questions or need anything additional, please feel free to reach out to XXXX at XXXX. I have cc 'd him on this email as well. 
Regarding Reimbursement : There were XXXX trips back and forth between XXXX and XXXX. The trip is approximately XXXX miles. This brings the total mileage to XXXX miles. At $ XXXX/mile that would bring the total mileage reimbursement to {$620.00}. 
The hotel room was {$87.00} a night for XXXX nights totaling a hotel reimbursement in the amount of {$170.00}. Per diem for food is $ XXXX/day/person. For XXXX people over a 4 day period that brings the total food reimbursement to {$600.00}. 
This brings the total reimbursement to just under {$1400.00}. 
We have already agreed to refund your appraisal fee in the amount of {$460.00}, which is currently in process. You are also going to be receiving your Close On Time Commitment Payout in the amount of {$500.00}. This brings the total reimbursement that is already in process to {$960.00}. In order to bring us to the {$1400.00} total, we will be issuing you a check in the amount of {$440.00} to cover the difference. 
{$620.00} ( mileage ) + {$170.00} ( lodging ) + {$600.00} ( food cost ) = {$1300.00} ( Rounded up to {$1400.00} ) {$1400.00} ( agreed reimbursement ) - {$460.00} ( appraisal refund in process ) - {$500.00} ( COTC in process ) = {$440.00} We will issue this check to the new address. Can you please confirm this is where you would like to have this mailed? 
Thank you very much and have a nice weekend! 
Sincerely, Consumer Lending Client Experience '' As you can see they created a final reimbursement figure by taking one issue, the travel reimbursement and then subtracting the "" in-process '' reimbursements. My strong contention is that there are three separate and distinct issues to be reimbursed. The three issues would total {$2300.00}. By doing a subtraction of two previous reimbursements for different issues they have substantially reduced their total payout. I find such an action to be cheap, insulting and a truly unprofessional way to address the needs of an aggrieved party to a horrific mortgage loan process as reviewed in my letter to the president ( attached ). A financial institution with the reach and impact that Bank of America has must be held to a higher standard and account for its actions.
